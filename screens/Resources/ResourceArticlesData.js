    titleText: `The Human Cost of Landmines`,
    subTitleText: `Scope And Nature Of The Crisis`,
    bodyText1: `Two categories of landmines are commonly in use: large antitank mines designed to be triggered by vehicles, and the small inexpensive antipersonnel mines designed specifically to kill or incapacitate a human being. According to Human Rights Watch, more than 340 antipersonnel landmine models have been produced in at least 48 nations around the world.`,
    bodyText2: `In recent decades the problems caused by landmines have been exacerbated by modem technology, such as the design of undetectable plastic blast mines which render their sighting and their removal extremely difficult. Furthermore, their small size and type of design have tended to attract children to play with them. Models such as ' scatterbabies ' and ' butterfly mines ' are cruel examples of the deceptive design.`,
    bodyText3: `Danger to civilians is further increased by the development of remote-delivery methods capable of deploying enormous numbers of mines over vast tracts of land from a distance, for example by aircraft, rocket or artillery. These methods facilitate the random, undetectable an d unmapped use of landmines.`,

    titleText: `United Nations Mine Action Service`,
    subTitleText: `Improvised Explosive Devices Lexicon`,
    bodyText1: `As seen in United Nations peace operations, and according to data from Action on Armed Violence, the rise in conflicts typified by asymmetric warfare and the increased use of IEDs is widespread. Explosive ordnance and IEDs affected at least 50 different countries and territories and all continents except Antarctica, resulting in over 170,000 casualties over the last decade. IEDs are predominantly used by non-state actors and usually disproportionately affect civilian populations, who account for 80% of IED-related
    casualties`,
    bodyText2: `Through its IED Threat Mitigation Advisory Team (TMAT), UNMAS provides IED threat mitigation expertise to inform strategic plans and policies, advise on the development of doctrine and training materials, and monitor and track emerging trends and mitigation technologies, in close collaboration with colleagues in the Department of Peace Operations, the Department of Operational Support and other United Nations entities, Member States, including troop contributing countries (TCCs), bilateral partners, and NGOs.`,
    bodyText3: `IEDs are designed to create maximum casualties and to impede political or social processes. The design, size and methods of emplacement are varied and continue to evolve to circumvent the countermeasures adopted to locate and mitigate these insidious devices. Access to the technology and components for their construction is easily shared across borders at the speed of the internet. They are inexpensive to fabricate and simple to produce using unsecured military munitions or easily available precursors that have legitimate dual uses, such as chemicals used for agricultural purposes. `,

    titleText: `UN Landmine and UXO Safety Awareness`,
    subTitleText: `Landmines`,
    bodyText1: `A mine is an explosive or other material, normally encased, designed to destroy or damage vehicles, boats, or aircraft, or designed to wound, kill, or otherwise incapacitate personnel. It may be detonated by the action of its target, the passage of time, or by controlled means. The term mine is also used to refer to the area in which a mine is placed, as in 'minefield'. The term mine is also used to refer to the explosive device itself, as in landmine, depth charge, or torpedo mine.`,
    bodyText2: `Mines are used to cause casualties to the enemy, to hinder movement, and to provide protection for important positions. They are also used in civil conflicts to disrupt infrastructures by denying the civilian population access to agricultural land, water, roads, schools, health care facilities and other socio-economic targets. Mines are also used to prevent the return of refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes.`,
    bodyText3: `Most mines are placed with the intention of being hidden, and are therefore seldom seen. They are generally buried within 15 cm of the earths surface, or laid on or above the ground (for example, on stakes or fixed to trees). They are often camouflaged to blend in with the surrounding terrain. Mines are often placed in groups, or in patterns, to increase the chance of killing or wounding a target. Mines are often placed in areas where people are likely to walk, such as roads, paths, and fields.`,

    titleText: `UN Landmine and UXO Safety Awareness`,
    subTitleText: `Anti-Personnel Landmines`,
    bodyText1: `An anti-personnel landmine is a mine designed to injure or kill one or more persons. Anti-personnel mines are usually detonated when they are stepped on or when a tripwire is
    disturbed, but they can also be set off by the passage of time or by controlled means. AP mines can be located under ground, on the ground surface, or fixed above ground level.`,
    bodyText2: `Once triggered, they cause death or serious injury by an explosive blast and/or flying fragments.
    They are grouped according to the manner in which they inflict injury: blast effect mines and
    fragmentation mines.`,
    bodyText3: `Blast effect mines are often very cheap, and are the most commonly found AP mines in the world. These mines are generally cylindrical in shape, and range in size from 7 to 16 cm in diameter and 5 to 10 cm in height. However, some blast effect AP mines are rectangular, or “shoe box”-shaped. They then range in size from 10 cm x 18 cm to 15 cm x 30 cm, and look like a small wooden or plastic box. They are usually painted in a neutral color, such as brown, green, or gray, and are often camouflaged to blend in with the surrounding terrain. A common type of blast effect AP mine is the air-delivered “butterfly” mine, commonly found in Afghanistan. These have a combination of odd shape and bright colour that makes them very attractive to children. They are typically found lying around in large numbers over a relatively limited area of ground.`,

    titleText: `UN Landmine and UXO Safety Awareness`,
    subTitleText: `Bounding AP Mines`,
    bodyText1: `Most bounding fragmentation AP mines are cylindrical in shape, with a single tubular fuse or a number of prongs sticking out from the top. They are typically around 15 cm in diameter and 28 cm in height.When these mines are laid it is common to see only the prongs sticking out above the soil. These
    mines are usually tan, olive, black, brown, and green, or are left unpainted. It is not uncommon for the spikes to be left as unpainted natural metal.`,
    bodyText2: `Bounding fragmentation AP mines are generally triggered by pressure on tripwires and/or direct pressure. When tripwires (usually of fine wire) are used, they can run as far as 30 meters from the mines`,
    bodyText3: `Once triggered, an initial charge lifts the mine up to waist height before the main charge detonates. Upon detonation, the explosion shoots out metal fragments in a 360-degree horizontal arc. These fragments can inflict lethal injuries at distances of up to 35 meters or more from the landmine, and can cause severe injuries at more than 100 meters. The fragments can also cause damage to vehicles and other equipment.`,
